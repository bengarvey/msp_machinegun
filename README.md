Quickly update and schedule new work on a directory of MS Project files

We were tediously going through and edited MS Project Files, so this script opens up all the files in a directory and asks for updates for each one.  It then reschedules all new work to be started the next day.

If anything, it's a good reference for how to manipulate MS Project files in Ruby.
